We planned to discuss an early drone preliminary design at this meeting, but we have some uncertainties. Therefore we would like to wait until we have met with a respondent from FFI before we make decisions, but a thought process has been initiated. Tomas has been in touch with \textbf{Kåre} who earlier had a job where he made drone parts out of carbon fibre (CFRP). Kåre might be helpful when we start constructing our drones.

The questions for FFI has been revisited and we have reformulated and specified some of the questions. We add questions to the Drive document as they come up, so we are able to get all the information we need from FFI when we meet them. The meeting with FFI that was scheduled October $28^{th}$ has been postponed to a date in November. 

We have discussed the importance of a good documentation standard for our bachelor thesis and we will create a template for our documentation. 

After a brief talk with Jan Dyre we were made aware of that the Pixhawk 1 is available again. \\\\
