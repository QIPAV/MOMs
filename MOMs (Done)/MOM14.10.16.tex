We have welcomed the two final group members, and our group is now full. \textbf{Kent Kjeldaas} is our second software developer and \textbf{Katrine Haune} is our third electrical engineering student. In total we are now one mechanical engineering student, two software developers and three electrical engineering students. 

We have discussed a potential bachelor group name and it is \textbf{VAPIQ}. \textbf{VA} from VAriable, \textbf{PI} from PItch, and \textbf{Q} from Quadcopter.

We have created a document on Google Drive where we have come up with some questions we have for FFI. We will specify these further at a later time. We have not met with a respondent from FFI yet, so the cooperation with the other bachelor group can not be specified at this time. Also we want to wait until we have met with FFI before we go in depth with systems "thinking" of our thesis. 

We have created two documents on Google Drive; one with main goals and specified activities for fall of 2016, and also a document with dates where group members will be unavailable for fall of 2016. 

Regrading the selection of the bachelor thesis' model we still want to do some in-depth research. 

Thomas has been in touch with \textbf{Arne Bj√∏rnar}, a major drone enthusiast, and we will schedule a meeting with him to discuss ideas and gain inspiration.
